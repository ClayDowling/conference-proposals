# You've Got An Arduino: Now What?

Building smart machines driven by computers is fun.  It's also something that
I'm nearly always hiring for.  So how do you get started?  Arduino is a tiny,
inexpensive computer that is easy to program, and easy to incorporate into
machines.

I love building machines with Arduino.  I want you to come out of this
session full of ideas for building your own cool device with Arduino.
I'll show you some devices built with Arduino, and some tools and
resources I found useful.
