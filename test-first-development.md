title: "Test First Development"
---

We all know that we _should_ be writing tests.  That doesn't mean that we all
do it.  In this session I'll walk you through how I approach tests, by writing
tests before I write code.  We'll also talk about how that changes my design: I
am rewarded for making more testable designs that are easier to understand, and
easier to maintain.

Attendees should come out with the necessary knowledge to implement a
test-first approach in their own projects.
