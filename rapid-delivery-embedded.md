# Rapid Delivery for Embedded Devices

Building smart devices is hard.  Building it in two weeks is harder.  I'll talk
about how we did it, how we won the work, and how you can apply the same
principles to your own work to deliver working products faster.

Coming out of this, you should understand the value of:

* Ruthlessly focusing on minimum viable product.
* Choosing the right team.
* Collaboration to quickly level up your team.
* Agressive testing to ensure that your code is always working.
* Team roles that you need to fill.
