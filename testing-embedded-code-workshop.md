title: "Testing Embedded Code Workshop"
---

Writing embedded code is fun.  Testing it, not so much.  In this workshop I'll share some of the techniques I've learned for writing test-first embedded code.

Participants will walk away with:

- Setting up a development environment.
- Test-first development in C.
- Software abstraction to isolate hardware-specific code.
- Test doubles that let us test with hardware we don't have.

Participants should bring a laptop with the following software installed:

- Docker
- A code text editor
