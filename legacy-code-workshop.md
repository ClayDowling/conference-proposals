# Legacy Code Workshop

I want to help you learn how to deal with your legacy code.  We all have code that's providing value, but it's expensive or intimidating to change.  In this workshop we'll take a code base that's a horrible mess, and work as a group to make it into something that's easier to modify and extend.
