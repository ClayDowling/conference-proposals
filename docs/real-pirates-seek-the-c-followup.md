# Real Pirates Seek the C!

This is a collection of links with more information for people interested in
learning more about C programming.

[The Basics and Pitfalls of Pointers in
C](https://hackaday.com/2018/04/04/the-basics-and-pitfalls-of-pointers-in-c/)
is a nice overview of pointers and how to use them.  It has an especially fun
section about how pointers are used when programming microcontrollers to make
programming easier.

[The C Programming Language](https://amzn.to/2q7E7lq) is the definitive
textbook on the language.  It's concise and to the point.  There have been
plenty of advances since this book was written, but this is probably the best
place to start.

[21st Century C: C Tips from the New School](https://amzn.to/2IuSlUX) is a
great resource for developers who were taught ANSI C, or learned from the
excellent K&R Book, and need to brush up on more modern techniques.  Possibly
one of my favorite books on C programming.
