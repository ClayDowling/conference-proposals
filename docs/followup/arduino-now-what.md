# You've Got an Arduino, Now What?

## Books for Learning

These books from Packt Publishing are approachable even for the inexperienced.

 * [Arduino by Example](https://amzn.to/2rmopUW)
 * Arduino Computer Vision Projects
 * Arduino Development Cookbook
 * Arduino Electronics Blueprints
 * Arduino for Secret Agents - this is fun if you want to get your kids involved.
 * [Arduino Robotic Projects](https://amzn.to/2HW8QK2)
 * Arduino Wearable Projects
 * Internet of Things with Arduino
 * Internet of Things with Arduino Blueprints
 * Learning C for Arduino - Not my favorite book, but give it a look to see if it works for you.

For a deep dive into electronics, [The Art of Electronics](https://amzn.to/2HTocyL), a.k.a. Horowitz & Hill.  Full of scary math and diagrams and magic.  If you want to really understand electronics, this book is the place to start.

[Arduino Workshop](https://amzn.to/2Id67iC) is a great deep dive into the Arduino world, including building your own from chips.

If you're unfamiliar with C or C++, look at [The C++ Programming Language](https://amzn.to/2jwEbZd) by Bjarne Stroustrupe.

## Other Hardware Interface Libraries

 * [AVR Libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/) - This is hard core, but you get great control.
 * [COSA](https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa) - A C++ library for the experienced embedded developer

## Testing Arduino Code

* [Test Driven Development for Embedded C](https://amzn.to/2ImUSEe)
* [Throw The Switch](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/) Good suite of tools for testing, and a lot of good advice about embedded C development.

## Electronics Parts

 * [Sunfounder New Nano Super Starter Kit](https://amzn.to/2IeDZvt) is a great starter, and even includes an Arduino Nano.  The Nano is easily my favorite form factor.
 * [A Sack of Arduinos](https://amzn.to/2KD4MAd) the price has gone up slightly, but it's still going to be a sack full of computers coming to your door at under $4 each.
 * [MPJA](http://www.mpja.com) the Harbor Freigh of parts suppliers.  They don't have everything, but they have a lot of stuff at good prices.
 * [Allied Electronics](https://www.alliedelec.com/) is a professional supply house.
 * [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) targetted at the hobbyist and full of good terminals.
 * [Ada Fruit](https://www.adafruit.com) also targetted at the hobbyist.
