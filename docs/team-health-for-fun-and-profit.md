- Figure out what is really important to you.
  - I'm able to meet my obligations to my family.
    - We have enough money to cover expenses.
    - I can support my wife in meeting her obligations.
    - I am actually present to support my wife emotionally.
  - I can be outside to experience the wonders of God's creation.
    - Day hikes
    - Longer excursions
  - Create things of lasting value.
    - Food
    - Experiences
    - Tools that make life better for the user
  - Leave the world better than I found it.
    - Create software that's easy to maintain
    - Help other people get skills to improve their own lives

- You are not your job.  Your job is only a means to do the things that are important to you.  
  - Nights and weekends are a waste of your time and your employer's money.  They're taking away from what's important to you.
  - Getting fired can be very therapeutic.  If my employers are unhappy with my performance there's a better than even chance that I'm pretty unhappy with theirs as well.  And it's probably messing up my ability to do the important things.

- Self Care is Best Care
  - You stopped being productive around six hours into your day.
  - Any serious work you do after that is something you'll have to redo later.
  - Eat lunch. Not at your desk.
  - Look after your health.  It's more important to your happiness and work performance than you realize.
    - You don't need a gym membership, but they're nice.
    - Walking is cheap and sometimes wonderful things will happen.
    - Body Weight exercises like situps and pushups don't take space.
    - Doctors are expensive, but way cheaper than hospitals.  $60 cash will probably get you an office visit, and you can always set up a payment plan.  Go before it gets serious and you need a hospital.
  - Thou Shalt Not Covet.
    - We usually show our best face to the public.
    - You see my life of flying to far away cities every week, living in hotels, and eating in restaurants on somebody else's dime.  You don't see the lonely nights and depression.
    - You see my step son's super hot wife.  You don't see that the stress of the marriage has caused him to be committed to a psychiatric ward for his own safety.

- You are your brother's keeper.
  - If one person on your team is having a bad time, everybody is going to have a bad time.
  - Be willing to listen.  Offer to listen.  Don't force the issue.
