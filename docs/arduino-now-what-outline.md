# You've Got An Arduino: Now What?

## Stage 1: I Don't Have an Arduino Yet

 * What Is Arduino?

   * 8-Bit Microprocessors
   * Arduino programming library

 * What Kinds Can I Get?

   * Atmel 328p boards
   * Really Cheap Boards
   * Building Your Own Arduino

 * What tools Do I Need?

   * Software

   * Hardware
     * Breadboard
     * Patch cables
     * Voltmeter

## Stage 2: Beyond Blink

 * Learning
   * Online Tutorials
   * Books for Beginners
   * Books for Deep Dives
 * Shields & Modules
 * Parts Kits

## Stage 3: Build a Thing

 * Tools for Designing Circuits
 * Sources for Parts
 * Building Multiples
   * Perf Boards
   * Printed Circuits
     - dirtypcbs.com - cheap chinese manufacturers
     - oshpark.com - low volume U.S. manufacturer.
 * Power Supplies
   * Battery Power
   * Plug In Power Supplies
   * Splitting Power
   * Controlling High Voltage Devices
     * Relays - Mechanical and Solid State
     * H-Bridge Transistors
     * Motor Drivers
   * What Happens When You Undere Power?
     * Logic fails - your code runs, but not in the order you wanted.
     * Devices work wrong
     * Devices can be destroyed, e.g. motors can burn out.

 * Connections
   * Soldering - Good for thing mounted on circuit board.
   * Mechanical Connections - Use for anything not attached to the board.

## Going Further

 * New Programming Techniques
   * Building from Makefiles
   * Expanding beyond the Arduino library
   * Test Driven Development - James Grenning's Book.
   * RTOS
   * Distributed Computing
 * Computers Beyond the Atmega 328
   * Teensy
   * Raspberry Pi
   * Beaglebone
