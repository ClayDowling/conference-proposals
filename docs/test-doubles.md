title: "Test Double"
---

Stub: Doesn't do anything, you just call it and 
  nothing happens.

Mock: Control interactions, record interactions.

Spy: Calls actual function, remembers what you did
  and informs on you to the test.

Spock: a wild night between and spy and a mock.

Fake: Smaller, easier to use version of the real
  thing.
