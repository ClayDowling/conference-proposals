# Getting To Done Faster: Testing Your Code

I want life to be better for developers.  Over the last few years I've
been working in new ways that let me get my work done faster, with fewer
bugs.  I want to share some of those ways with you, to make your life
better too.  I'll show you how to start with your tests as a way to get
working code to your customers faster.
